# Principles of Operating Systems - Project 2

## Description

This project focuses on implementing a multi-threaded server capable of matrix multiplication using a pool of worker threads. The server handles requests to set the number of available workers and performs matrix multiplication efficiently.

The main features of this project include:

Dynamic Worker Allocation: The server allows you to set the number of worker threads to efficiently manage resources based on the workload.

Matrix Multiplication: The server performs matrix multiplication using a pool of worker threads, improving computation speed.

Thread Safety: The project demonstrates the implementation of thread safety mechanisms, including mutex locks, to ensure correct operation in a multi-threaded environment.
